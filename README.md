Overview: 

Kybi is a **bike safety mobile app** that aims to **crowdsource information about bike safety and the lack of it in city roads.** Anyone can pin places where they feel safe or unsafe to ride a bike, report traffic hazards, and conduct bike safety audits of city roads. This data will be **used by city governments to identify which road segments are unsafe, why, and how they can be made safer for bikers.**

With the safety scores readily available, users can see which areas have a better safety perception than others and make smarter decisions on which routes or bikeways to take.

The safety score can be broken down to 9 factors: 

1. **Presence of bike lane** (on-road bike routes, on-road marked bike lanes, and off-road bike paths)
2. **Bike way quality** (broken / unpaved / blocked bike paths, road surface during wet and dry season, pavement markings, presence of sharp curves, steep terrain slope, traffic lights)
3. **Lighting** (Availability of enough light to see all around you)
4. **Openness to see in all directions**
5. **Traffic density**
6. **Crowd density**
7. **Availability of bike rack near destination**
8. **Availability of CCTV (security) around the area**
9. **Land use** (residential or economic zones)

Kybi uses a combination of  machine learning to generate 

Our vision is to become the acknowledged data provider of data for safe bikeways and cycling urban mobility.
